# What is this?
A C# utility that fullscreens games by making them 'borderless', stopping them from behaving all weird when alt-tabbing out of them. Basically, it's a clean, free alternative to Borderless Gaming.

# How good is it?
It doesn't do anything fancy. It just makes your games borderless fullscreen, and that's about it; no 'favourites', no weird stuff, just basic fullscreening.
